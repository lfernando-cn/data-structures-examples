# Data Structures Learning Repository


This repository serves as a collection of data structures implemented during my studies. The goal is to have a centralized place to store and showcase the implementations of various data structures as I learn and explore them.

## List of Data Structures

- **ADT Vector**
  - Description: Basic implementation of an Abstract Data Type (ADT) Vector using arrays.
- [ADT Vector](https://github.com/lfernando-cn/data-structures-examples/blob/main/AbstractDataType-Vector/src/ADTVector.java)
- <!-- Add more as you implement -->

Each data structure is implemented in Java within its respective folder.
