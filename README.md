# Data Structures Learning Repository


This repository serves as a collection of data structures implemented during my studies. The goal is to have a centralized place to store and showcase the implementations of various data structures as I learn and explore them.

## List of Data Structures

- [ADT Vector](https://github.com/lfernando-cn/data-structures-examples/blob/main/AbstractDataType-Vector/src/ADTVector.java)
- [ADT Stack](https://github.com/lfernando-cn/data-structures-examples/blob/main/AbstractDataType-Stack/src/Stack.java)
- [ADT Queue](https://github.com/lfernando-cn/data-structures-examples/blob/main/AbstractDataType-Queue/src/Queue.java)
- <!-- Add more as you implement -->

Each data structure is implemented in Java within its respective folder.
